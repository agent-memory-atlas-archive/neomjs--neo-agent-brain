/**
 * The post-release lifecycle uploads the Knowledge Base and writes nothing into the Engine checkout.
 *
 * The Engine no longer carries a content mirror: its conversations publish from
 * `neomjs/github-content-sync`, and its release notes stay where they were authored. A sync, a
 * broad stage or a push from this script would recreate the retired tree on the Engine's `dev`,
 * and every one of its commits would bypass the hooks by design. A source assertion is the only
 * instrument short of cutting a release.
