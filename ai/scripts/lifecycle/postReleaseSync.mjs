/**
 * @summary Brain-side post-release lifecycle: the Knowledge Base upload, behind a fail-closed preflight.
 *
 * This step used to live inside `buildScripts/release/publish.mjs` as its stage 5.5, which made the
 * ENGINE's release script import `ai/services.host.mjs` and spawn
 * `ai/scripts/maintenance/uploadKnowledgeBase.mjs` — the one coupling that forced the agent OS to
 * be present and importable before the engine could release at all. The engine↔Brain boundary is
 * one-way (the Brain may consume the engine; never the reverse), so this half of the release lives
 * HERE, beside the Knowledge Base it uploads. `publish.mjs` ends after the GitHub release is created
 * and prints this script as the next runbook step. The Engine checkout is a distinct target
 * authority and must be named — the Brain checkout/cwd is never treated as the release:
 *
 *     npm run ai:post-release-sync -- --target-repo-root /absolute/path/to/neo
 *
 * It writes nothing into the Engine checkout. The Engine carries no content mirror: conversations
 * and release notes publish from `neomjs/github-content-sync`, and the release note stays where it
 * was authored, in `.github/RELEASE_NOTES/`.
 *
 * Ordering contract:
 *
 * 0. Preflight (`postReleasePreflight.mjs`): current branch is `dev`; the version derives from
 *    `package.json` only (no CLI override — an interpolated flag is an injection surface) and is
 *    strict semver; the working tree is clean. All three hold before the first irreversible step.
 * 1. Upload the Knowledge Base (the release's own artifacts are what it serves).
